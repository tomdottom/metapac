# metapac

multi-backend declarative package manager

`metapac` allows you to maintain a consistent set of packages and repos,
across multiple machines. It also makes setting up a new system with your
preferred packages and repos from your preferred package managers much
easier.

## Installation

### With Cargo

```shell
cargo install metapac
```

### With Arch User Repository

```shell
paru -S metapac
```

### With Copr (Fedora/RHEL/EPEL)

This is an **unofficial** repo maintained by [komapro](https://github.com/komapro).

```shell
dnf copr enable komapro/metapac
dnf install metapac
```

## Meta

`metapac` is a meta package manager, that means it does not directly
implement the functionality to install packages on your system, instead it
provides a standardised interface for installing packages from other
package managers. See the [Supported Backends](#supported-backends) section
for a list of the currently supported backend package managers.

## Declarative

`metapac` is also a declarative package manager, that means that you
declare in `.toml` group files the packages and repos you would like
installed on your system and then run one of the `metapac` commands which
read these group files and then operate on your system to do some function
such as install packages and repos in your group files that are not present
on your system yet (`metapac sync`), or remove packages and repos present
on your system but not in your group files (`metapac clean`).

The group files are then stored with your other system configuration files
and so can be tracked with version control.

## Usage

### Enable backends

By default all backends are disabled. Enable the backends you want
`metapac` to manage in the config file. See the [`Config`](#config) section
for more details.

### Migrating a default system into `metapac`

Run `metapac unmanaged` and save the output into a group file in
`metapac`'s `groups/` folder, see the [`Group Files`](#group-files)
section for the exact location of this folder on your operating system.

For example, on linux:

```console
mkdir -p ~/.config/metapac/groups
metapac unmanaged > ~/.config/metapac/groups/all.toml
```

Now `metapac` won't try to remove any of your explicitly installed packages
when you run `metapac clean`.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you run `metapac clean` without first configuring your group files
> with the packages you want installed then `metapac` will attempt to
> remove all of your packages and repos from your enabled backends.
>
> `metapac clean` will always show you which packages and repos it intends
> to remove and ask for confirmation, so make sure to double check that the
> expected packages and repos are being removed before confirming.

### Adding a new package/repo

Use a text editor to add the package/repo to an existing group file or
create a new group file and add the package/repo to it. See the [`Group
Files`](#group-files) section for the group file syntax.

You can then run `metapac sync` and `metapac` will install the package if
it is not already present on your system.

### Removing a package/repo

Do the opposite of [`Adding a new package`](#adding-a-new-packagerepo). But
instead use `metapac clean` after editing your group files to remove all
packages/repos on your system not in your group files.

### Hooks

Hooks are commands that you can add per-package or per-repo in your group
files. They get run by `metapac` at various stages in some of `metapac`'s
commands.

One of the main use-cases for hooks is to allow you to declaratively
maintain your enabled `systemd` services alongside each package in your
group files. See the [`Group Files`](#group-files) section for some
examples.

- `before_install`: Run before a package/repo is installed. Only applies to the
  `metapac sync` command.
- `after_install`: Run after a package/repo is installed. Only applies to the
  `metapac sync` command.
- `before_sync`: Run before installing any packages/repos, regardless of
  whether the package/repo was already installed or not. Only applies to the
  `metapac sync` command.
- `after_sync`: Run after installing all packages/repos, regardless of
  whether the package/repo was already installed or not. Only applies to the
  `metapac sync` command.

Repo/package hooks are run before/after installing all repos/packages, not
between each repo/package.

### Refreshing backend package metadata

Run `metapac refresh` to update local package metadata for all enabled
backends (e.g. `apt-get update` for `apt`, `brew update` for `brew`, `dnf
makecache` for `dnf`). Use `--backends` to target specific backends, or
`--backends all` to include every backend.

### Enable more logs for debugging

You can enable additional log levels by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment
variable, this can be useful to see which commands are being run on the
backends by `metapac`. For example, `RUST_LOG=trace metapac unmanaged`. See
<https://docs.rs/env_logger> for more information.

### Advanced usage

For more advanced usage read through the remaining sections, especially the
[`Config`](#config) section. You can also run `metapac --help` to get a
list of all of the available commands.

### apt

#### Package Groups

Arch has two special types of packages called meta packages and package
groups. (See
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Meta_package_and_package_group>).
`metapac` only supports meta packages in group files since they are "real"
packages whereas groups are not "real". This is because meta packages are
normal PKGBUILD files with no content of themselves but which have several
dependencies, whereas package groups are special cases that don't have a
corresponding PKGBUILD file. For example, running `pacman -Si nerd-fonts`
returns "error: package 'nerd-fonts' was not found".

If you still want the behavior of a meta package you have two options.

Firstly, consider creating your own meta package with the same packages as
the group. Consider also publishing this package to the AUR so other users
can also benefit from it. Convention has it that meta packages end in
`-meta`, for example, the meta package version of `nerd-fonts` might be
called `nerd-fonts-meta` (Although `nerd-fonts-meta` does not yet exist at
the time of writing, 2025-09-03).

Alternatively, you could create a new group file using the packages from
the package group, which you can get from the command: `pacman -Sgq
<group_name>`.

#### Pinning a Package to a Repository

By default a package is installed from whichever repository your package
manager resolves its name to. To force a specific repository, pin it with the
`"<repo>/<package>"` shorthand or the long-form `repo` option (both shown in
the example group file).

The repo is only an install-time hint: when installing a pinned package
`metapac` passes `<repo>/<package>` (e.g. `extra/firefox`) to the package
manager instead of the bare package name. It does not affect how installed
packages are matched against your group files (matching is always done by
package name alone), so changing or adding a repo for an already-installed
package will not cause it to be reinstalled, and `metapac` does not check
which repository an installed package actually came from.

The repo is passed on to the `package_manager` set in your config, so it
must be understood by that package manager. In particular, an `aur/<package>`
pin only works when `package_manager` is an AUR helper (`paru`, `yay`,
`pikaur` or `pamac`) and not plain `pacman`, which has no `aur` repo.

### brew

Standard usage.

### bun

Standard usage.

### cargo

Standard usage.

### dnf

Standard usage.

### flatpak

Standard usage.

### mas

Standard usage.

### mise

Standard usage.

### nix

The `nix` backend uses `nix profile` commands.

Packages are matched by profile element name. If you use custom installables
you should set `options.installable` explicitly so installs are reproducible.

### npm

If on linux you might need to first run `npm config set prefix ~/.local`.

### pipx

Standard usage.

### pnpm

You might need to first run `pnpm setup`.

### scoop

`scoop` doesn't differentiate between implicit and explicit packages.
Therefore, you will need to list all packages and their dependencies in
your group files. See
<https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/issues/4276>.

### snap

Standard usage.

### uv

Standard usage.

### vscode

Standard usage.

### winget

Standard usage.

### xbps

Standard usage.

### yarn

Standard usage.

### zypper

## Group Files

```toml
# metapac's group files (like this one) should be placed in the following location
# dependent on the operating system as specified in the `dirs` crate:
# | Platform | Value                                             | Example                                                  |
# | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
# | Linux    | $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME/.config/metapac/groups/ | /home/alice/.config/metapac/groups/                      |
# | macOS    | $HOME/Library/Application Support/metapac/groups/ | /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/metapac/groups/ |
# | Windows  | {FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\metapac\groups\         | C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\metapac\groups\           |
#
# The packages for each backend in group files can come in two formats, short-form
# and long-form:
#
# short-form syntax is simply a string of the name of the package.
#
# long-form syntax is a table which contains several fields which can
# optionally be set to specify install options on a per-package basis.
# The "package" field in the table specifies the name of the package.
#
# For example, the following two packages are equivalent:
# arch = {
#   packages = [
#     "metapac",
#     { name = "metapac" }
#   ]
# }
